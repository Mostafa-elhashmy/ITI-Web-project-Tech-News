    <h2>Foundations of Digital Defense</h2>
    <div class="foundations">
      <div class="foundations-content">
        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, <br>   and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are <br> usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive <br> information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal <br> business processes. A career in cybersecurity is crucial and <br> ever-evolving, requiring a diverse skill set to combat <br>the increasingly sophisticated threats in our digital world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our comprehensive track starts with the basics, ensuring you <br> build a strong foundation before diving into advanced topics. <br> You'll learn about information security processes, threat <br> landscapes, common vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies that form the core of cybersecurity expertise.</p>
